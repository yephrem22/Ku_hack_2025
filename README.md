## Inspiration
Two of our team members have grandparents who were diagnosed with Alzheimer’s, and we've seen firsthand how difficult memory loss can be. This can be difficult for those affected, and for their loved ones as well. This personal connection inspired us to build a tool that helps preserve meaningful moments and empower those going through similar experiences to relive and reinforce their special memories.

## What It Does
Recall is a memory-supportive web platform designed to help users with early signs of Alzheimer’s or memory challenges stay connected with their past. It offers four main features:

**Mementos Box** – Users answer thoughtful life questions and store the responses, creating a digital journal they can revisit.

**Memory Quiz** – Based on the user’s own answers, this feature transforms those memories into a custom quiz to reinforce recall.

**Photo Album** – Users upload and tag their favorite photos with brief stories or descriptions to relive special moments.

**Risk Factor Quiz** – Powered by Gemini AI, this quiz analyzes user responses related to health and lifestyle to provide a cognitive health risk assessment.

## How We Built It
**Frontend:** Built using Svelte, which was a new technology for our team and offered a smooth, responsive UI experience.

**Backend:** We used Supabase to handle user authentication and store memory data securely.
AI Integration: Gemini AI was integrated into our risk factor quiz to interpret user inputs and provide a personalized analysis.

##Challenges We Faced
Our biggest hurdle was version control with Git. With multiple contributors and lots of parallel development, resolving merge conflicts and syncing branches took time and coordination. We learned the importance of regular commits, clear communication, and pull request hygiene.

## Accomplishments We're Proud Of
One major win for us was successfully implementing secure user authentication, allowing users to create personalized accounts and safely store their memories. It gave our project a real sense of depth and future scalability.

## What We Learned
None of us had used Svelte before this hackathon, and diving into a new framework under pressure taught us how to learn fast, debug creatively, and collaborate efficiently. We also got hands-on experience working with AI APIs and real-time databases.

## What's Next for Recall
In future versions of Recall, we’d love to introduce interactive memory games to further engage users and stimulate cognitive recall in a fun, gamified way. We’re also exploring features like shared memory spaces for families, voice-based interactions, and deeper AI-driven personalization.
